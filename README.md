This is repository for my practice projects, which helped me to understand Machine Learning and Gen AI concepts better  

-- Project 1 (Blooms Taxonomy Level) --

In this project, i have used DistilBert model for predicting the Blooms Taxonomy Level of questions. I used a dataset consisting of 300 instanses (Questions and Levels) to train the model to my data and used 50 EPOCHS to fine tune the model.
