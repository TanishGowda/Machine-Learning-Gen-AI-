# Machine-Learning-Gen-AI-
This is repository for my practice projects, which helped me to understand Machine Learning and Gen AI concepts better  

-- Project 1 (Blooms Taxonomy Level (Blooms_Level.ipynb)) --

In this project, i have used DistilBert model for predicting the Blooms Taxonomy Level of questions. I used a dataset consisting of 300 instanses (Questions and Levels) to train the model to my data and used 50 EPOCHS to fine tune the model.

-- Project 2 (Diffusion Model) --

In this project, i attempted to train and test a Diffusion Model on MNIST (Images of handwritten numbers) dataset. I also used a UNET Neural Network (with Time Embeddings) for better and more accurate pattern recognition and prediction.

-- Project 3 (Stable Diffusion Pipeline) --

In this project, i used a pre-trained Stable Diffusion Pipeline to generate an image based on a prompt, i then added noise to the generated image and again used the Stable Diffusion Pipeline to again denoise the noisy image. This project was done in order to understand the working of Diffusion Models.
